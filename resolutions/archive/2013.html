							<dt>Launch at least 1 Side Project</dt>
							<dd>I know I say this every year, but this is the year I do it. I have a lot of viable ideas, the skill, and the drive. Plus I'll have more time to do it. See my next resolution is...</dd>
							<dd class="red">Well, not launched, but working for me. Besides! Look at the other two below!</dd>

							<dt>Say <em>NO</em> more often</dt> 
							<dd>I say Yes too much. There have been times where I didn't really want to do a project or a task or a request but did it anyway. It bit into my personal time or time I could have dedicated to a side project.</dd>
							<dd class="red">Not as often as I probably should have, but I turned away quite a bit of work this year.</dd>
							
							<dt>Get a 2<sup>nd</sup> Book Published</dt>
							<dd>I really enjoyed making the first one. It's something I'd like to continue to do. I have 2 ideas in mind.</dd>
							<dd class="red"><em>Responsive Design with WordPress</em>, out now! (<a href="http://rwdwp.com">link</a>)</dd>
							
							<dt>Launch an Online Course</dt>
							<dd>Online learning is where it's at, plus it's a great way to earn some extra income with little effort post-launch.</dd>
							<dd class="red">I developed a WordPress course for Sessions.edu. It's going through audit now.</dd>
							
							<dt>Read 10 Books</dt>
							<dd>I need to read more. And more diverse topics too.</dd>
							<dd class="red">Do you want me to list them? I can if you want.</dd>
							
							<strike><dt>Lose Weight</dt>
							<dd>Every. year. All the time.</dd></strike>
							
							<dt>Watch More Movies</dt>
							<dd>I saw a lot of movies last year, but there were a few I really wanted to see &amp; didn't.</dd>
							<dd class="red">Saw everything I wanted to except Thor!</dd>
